// Next.js App Router sitemap generator. Renders to /sitemap.xml.
//
// At nationwide scale this becomes the primary discovery surface for
// search engines — every event detail page that's `active` or `pinned`
// (and `public` visibility) becomes a crawlable URL. Goal: maximize
// indexing of /event/{id} pages so users searching "[city] mtg
// commander tournament" find PlayIRL.GG.
//
// Sitemap protocol caps at 50,000 URLs per file. We hit that ceiling at
// roughly 50k active events; if/when we cross it, switch to a sitemap
// index with per-format or per-state sub-sitemaps. Today's volume is
// ~hundreds, projected nationwide ~25k — comfortably one file.
